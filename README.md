- Explain how you ensure user is the right one starting the app
To ensure the user starting the app is the correct one (I assume the owner of the device), I implemented a biometric authentication, requiring any fingerprint saved in the phone. As long as the owner of the device is the only one knowing its pin code and the only one with a registered fingerprint, the display of the account is safe. Also, resuming the app reinstantiate the first activity, with the required biometric authentication.
