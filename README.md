- Explain how you ensure user is the right one starting the app:<br/>
To ensure the user starting the app is the correct one (I assume the owner of the device), I implemented a biometric authentication, requiring any fingerprint saved in the phone.

Also, resuming the app reinstantiate the first activity, with the required biometric authentication.
